-- Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: 
-- Name, Grade and Mark. Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8.
-- The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first.
-- If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically.
-- Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
-- If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.
-- Write a query to help Eve.
